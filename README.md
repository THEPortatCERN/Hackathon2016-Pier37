### Pier37 - ID Hunters


#### Efficient Forensic Photos

After natural disasters with thousands of victims, officials are often left with no other choice than burying or burning dead bodies without identifying the person. This causes additional pain to the relatives, but also creates a difficult legal and financial situation. Improving the visual identification toolset of forensic disaster teams would make their work more efficient and will leave less families in uncertainty.
